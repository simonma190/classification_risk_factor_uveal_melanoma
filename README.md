Figure 1.
Boxplot of the bootstrap 95% confidence interval of the area under the curve (AUC). The vertical axis represents AUC values ranging from 0 to 1, with higher value indicating better predictive performance. The horizontal axis represents the different models trained and evaluated in this study. Each box indicates the interquartile range of the AUC distribution, with the horizontal line inside the box representing the median AUC value.

Figure 2.
Representative ultrasound (US) and ultra-widefield fundus (UWF) original images, with a Grad-CAM saliency map showing the areas of highest probability for the category prediction model. Colors represent regions in order of decreasing performance: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue.
